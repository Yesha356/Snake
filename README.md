# Snake
Snake Game using Java Language

The “snake game” is a game made in Java language using GUI.
The main objective of this game is to feed an increasing length of a snake with food particles which are found at random positions.
Your goal is to move the snake and eat as many “food” blocks as possible. 
There is only one food block at any given time. When the food is eaten, the snake grows in length.
During the process of travelling, if the snake hits the boundary wall, it does not die, instead it comes out from the opposite wall as though there is a continuation in the movement.
If you hit the snake itself the game is over.
